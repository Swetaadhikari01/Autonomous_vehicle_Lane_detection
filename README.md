Autonomous Vehicle Lane Detection 

This project uses OpenCV and Python to detect road lanes in images or videos using classical computer vision techniques.

# Features
- Canny edge detection
- Region of Interest (ROI) masking
- Hough Line Transform for lane line detection
- Works with both *image* and *video*

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
```bash
pip install opencv-python
